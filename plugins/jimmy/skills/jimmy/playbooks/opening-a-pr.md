### Opening a PR

Invoked at the end of every other playbook.

**Worktree.** Work from a git worktree off main. Parallel writers each get their own worktree; never let two workers write the same branch. Dirty branch with unrelated work: patch out, fresh worktree, apply. Snarled worktree: recreate it from main and redo minimally without destroying unrelated user work.

**Commits.** Commit liberally; rebase into small, ordered commits before opening PRs. Each commit is a future PR: landable, ordered to tell the story. Amend when the fix belongs in a just-made commit; new commit when separable.

**PRs.** Run `deslop` when available, or perform the equivalent diff cleanup before commit. Run `no-comments` before review. Write every PR title, PR description, and commit body with `technical-writing`, then apply `unslop`. Apply every technical-writing layer except Diátaxis. Use one word for each action, keep articles, and avoid `-ing` when a plain verb works.

**Titles.** Use Conventional Commits in the form `type(scope): subject`. Use `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `perf` as the type. Use the changed area, such as `pstack` or `jimmy`, as the scope. Keep the subject short and imperative. Apply the same `/technical-writing` and `/unslop` pass as the body. Name a real symbol when one carries the change. For example, `fix(pstack): retarget opening-a-pr babysit trigger`. Do not add a trailing period.

**Descriptions.** Use these sections in order. Drop a section when it is empty.

- `## Why`. State the intent and why this approach fits.
- `## Scope`. State facts from the diff. Name real symbols and paths. Name both sides of a rename or retarget. State what is in and out when the boundary matters.
- `## Tradeoffs`. State real choices only. Skip this section when there are none.
- `## Blast Radius`. State who and what the change touches. Explain why the change is safe or risky. If main is red without the fix, name the continuing cost.
- `## Verification`. State how you ran each check and its rigor. Name the real path, such as `control-cli`, `control-ui`, or the targeted tests. State the outcome of each check, not only the command name.

After these sections, attach videos or screenshots when they prove a claim. Do not use `## Summary` or `## Test plan` boilerplate. A commit body does not restate its subject.

**Forge.** Resolve the version-control workflow and forge before the first PR operation. Keep those choices for create, edit, view, watch, and merge. Follow [Version control](../SKILL.md#version-control).

**Size and stacks.** Create, update, and submit the chain through the selected workflow. Prefer five narrow PRs to one large PR. A stack is a base-branch chain. The root PR targets trunk; each child branch sits on its parent's exact tip and its PR targets the parent branch. Branch from trunk only for independent work. Update from trunk before substantial stack work.

**Readiness.** Open every PR ready, never as a draft. Inspect the selected workflow's local help before submission. Cloud-agent PR tools may default to draft, so request ready status explicitly. Read the PR through the resolved forge before you refer to its status.

**Babysit.** Opening a PR does not start a babysit. Post the URL and keep building. Finish the phase or stack first. Run a separate babysit pass only when the user asks for one after the whole stack exists. A babysit for each new PR stalls the build and spends checks on commits that later waves restart. Push back when feedback drifts from intent.

A subagent that opens a PR runs `interrogate`, `/deslop`, and `/no-comments`. It returns the URL and does not babysit. Return to the parent.
